# Legal Case Research Assistant with GPT-4 Integration

## Project Overview

This project aims to address a significant challenge in the legal profession: the difficulty of locating specific, niche legal cases to support legal arguments. While law schools often focus on well-known cases, actual legal practice requires familiarity with more obscure precedents. Our solution is to create a comprehensive database that meticulously catalogs a wide array of cases, especially those less commonly referenced, and integrates these cases with the GPT-4 model. This will empower lawyers to efficiently find relevant cases for their unique legal issues.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Legal Case Database**: A vast collection of legal cases, with a focus on niche and lesser-known precedents.
- **GPT-4 Integration**: Advanced AI model to assist in analyzing and finding relevant cases based on user queries.
- **Agent-Style User Interface**: Simple, intuitive question-and-answer interface for easy interaction.
- **React + TypeScript**: Robust and scalable web application development.

### Collaborators

- Law Student: Providing insights and ensuring the database accurately reflects legal complexities.
- Developers: Focusing on integrating the GPT-4 model and developing the user interface.
